This document serves to learn what are quests and/or missions in videogames and how to implement them.

# What is a quest and/or mission?

It is a task that the player or group of players must complete in order to receive a reward and/or continue the plot of the game.

# What types of quests are there?

There are many types of quests but we will look at two different ways of categorizing them:

## According to importance:

### Main:

 The main missions are those that have similar objectives with those of the main story and continue with this one.

### Secondary:

Missions with parallel stories to those of the main story.

### According to how they are obtained and continue:

### From NPC:

They are obtained from an NPC.

### Pop up:

Missions that appear without the need for an NPC.

### Chained secondary missions: 

Missions that when finished have continuation.

### How to design the missions:

There are several ways to organize how to design a mission or a chain of missions but we will see the one that I think is the most efficient.

## The background:

You have to take into account the story, theme, setting and general narrative that the game tells to make the missions credible.

## The hook:

Description of the key idea as briefly as possible. 
To see if the mission concept works, ask yourself these questions:

- Why is this mission fun to play?
- What makes it different from other missions?
- What is the purpose of the mission?

## The hook:

Missions usually belong to a chain and need to be defined.

- How many related missions are there?
- Where is the mission located (part of the map where it is located)?
- Who or what does the mission give you?
- What do you need to complete the mission (items or mechanics)?

With these questions solved we can get an idea of how the missions will be. And begin to raise the chain of missions in the same way that the missions have been raised.

## Quest chart:

Graphic representation of what the mission chain looks like in a schematic way that is easy to see. It is mainly used to organize the missions.

# Tips to improve the missions:

These are some tips that you may have already taken into account but if not I hope they will help you.

- That the secondary missions have some effect in the main missions. This can be seen well in the game "The witcher 3".
- Do not waste the player's time by making him/her go round and round a lot.
- Make things clear to the player so he doesn't get lost.
